# OverwatchRandomizer
Need a list of Overwatch heroes in a random order? Here you go!
It's an HTML file running some simple JavaScript, so literally just open it in your browser and you're good to go.  

Known issues:  
If you hit the randomizer button twice it won't work. But you're only supposed to do it once anyway, don't cheat!!
